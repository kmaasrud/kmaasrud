<h1 align="center">Hi.</h1>

<div align="center">

I generally don't endorse the use of GitHub anymore. [Here](https://giveupgithub.org) is why. A lot of good alternatives exist, of which I have settled on [SourceHut](https://sr.ht/~/kmaasrud) as my preferred option. Of course, a lot of projects depend on the discoverability of GitHub to stay alive and get enough contributions, which I fully support. My employer also hosts their codebase on GitHub. For that reason, I'm keeping my user and a few of my repositoriesâ€”with the hope that we'll get the freedom utopia we deserve some day.

I recommend reading up on the matter and emplore you to consider taking similar actions for your projects as well.
